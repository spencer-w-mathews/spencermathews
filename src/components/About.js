          I am a skilled developer with expertise in React, C#, SQL, TypeScript,
          CSS, Express, and MongoDB. I have spent the past two years
          contributing to the health tech industry, building impactful solutions
          that improve lives. Before transitioning into tech, I honed my
          interpersonal skills over five years working at a carwash, where I
          developed a strong ability to connect with people and understand their
          needsâ€”a foundation that complements my technical expertise.
